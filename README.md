Answer to Question:

The problem is there are some words that contain the keyword in itself. The phrase, “I know
all the state capitals” has the word "know" in it which contains the keyword "no," so it would call the "no" response. Also the phrase “I like vegetables smothered in cheese," has the word "smothered" which contains the keyword "mother" and would ultimately call the "mother" response.
